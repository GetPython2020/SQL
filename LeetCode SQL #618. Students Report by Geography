A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The studentsâ€™ location information are stored in table student as below.

name	continent
Jack	America
Pascal	Europe
Xi	Asia
Jane	America
Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. 
The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.
For the sample input, the output is:

America	Asia	Europe
Jack	Xi	Pascal
Jane		
Follow-up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, can you write a query to generate the student report?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select America, Asia, Europe
from
(select
   row_number() over (partition by continent order by name) as asid
   name as Asia
   from student
   where continent = 'Asia' ) as t1
right join
(select
    row_number() over (partition by continent order by name) as amid
    name as America
    from student
    where continent = 'America') as t2 on t1.asid=t2.amid
left join
(select
    row_num() over (partition by continent order by name) as euid
    name as Europe
    from student
    where continent = 'Europe') as t3 on t2.amid=t3.euid
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select
  (case when continent = 'America' then name else '' end) America,
  (case when continent = 'Europe' then name else '' end) Europe,
  (case when continent = 'Asia' then name else '' end) Asia
from student

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select [America],[Europe],[Asia]
from (select name,continent from student) as D
pivot(min(name) for continent in ([America],[Europe],[Asia]) ) as P
